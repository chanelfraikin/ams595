This project estimates pi using the Monte Carlo algorithm. 

How to Use

1. Open project1.m in MATLAB.

2. The file has three sections (Task 1, Task 2, Task 3). Run each section individually:

Task 1: Uses a for loop with a fixed number of points, plots convergence, and computational cost.

Task 2: Uses a while loop to reach a user-specified precision and reports the number of iterations.

Task 3: Turns Task 2 into a function and displays the final result on the graph.
