This project estimates Ï€ using Monte Carlo simulation with three different approaches, all contained in project1.m.

How to Use

Open project1.m in MATLAB.

The file has three sections (Task 1, Task 2, Task 3).

Run each section individually:

Task 1: Uses a for loop with a fixed number of points, plots convergence, and compares precision vs. computational cost.

Task 2: Uses a while loop to reach a user-specified precision (without using pi) and reports the number of iterations.

Task 3: Turns Task 2 into a function with live plotting and displays the final result on the graph.
